## Client Libraries

Api-client libraries in each sub-folder for your language

- [Python 3.X](python_client)
- [Typescript](typescript-node)

Each sub-folder has it's own readme

## About
---
Interact with the [Globe API](https://developers.globedx.com) from your preferred langauge.
The API is mainly Websocket, with a few REST endpoints.

Client libraries are updated and maintained by Globe.

See the docuementation for the [Globe API here](https://developers.globedx.com/en#introduction).

**Important**

For private requests, and to use the private examples for trading and other authenticated requests you will need to first create an API key in your account, for this you will need to [register for an account on Glone](https://globedx.org/en/register).

## Contributing
---

We warmly welcome all contributions, either in your preferred language that doesn't have a client library yet, or if you have suggestions on how to improve the API, features you want to see or if your language is not supported yet, please do leave an issue and we will prioritise the work.
